## Problem 1

Read in and tidy data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_double(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Do this for one cityâ€¦

``` r
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df, 
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = (exp(estimate) - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = (exp(estimate) + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     1.028 |     1.699 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.978 |     2.663 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.155 |     0.696 |

Do this for all cities

``` r
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = 
      map(.x = data, 
                 ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = (exp(estimate) - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = (exp(estimate) + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI"))
```

``` r
models_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Compare on prediction error

First: build the models specified using the code from cross validation
lecture

What model would work in this context? Start by picking variables that
might be interesting and inserting them into models already known, look
at residuals and see if there are patterns, are there any big issues in
the dataset, etc.

Load in data as baby\_df

weeks & bwt = lm(bwt \~ gaweeks, data = baby\_df) main effects only =
lm(bwt \~ blength + gaweeks, data = baby\_df)

Residuals:

baby\_df %\>% modelr::add\_residuals(weeks & bwt) %\>% ggplot(aes(x =
gaweeks, y = resid)) %\>% geom\_point()

## Problem 3

Fit model to dataset, make sure you can compute adjusted R2 and the log
betas term broom::tidy, get estimated coefficients, may need to
rearrange to get intercepts and estimates next to each other to multiply
them

Figure out the model and calculations first, then figure out how to
bootstrap it

Use plots to get R2 and CI for this
